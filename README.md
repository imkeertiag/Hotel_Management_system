# Hotel Management System (C++ & OOP)
This project implements a Hotel Management System using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming principles.

# Features
Guest Management: Add, modify, and delete guest information.
Room Management: Allocate, deallocate, and manage room details.
Reservation Handling: Book and cancel room reservations.
Billing: Generate bills for guests including room charges and additional services.
Reports: Generate various reports such as occupancy, revenue, guest lists, etc.


# Object-Oriented Concepts Utilized
Classes and Objects: Represents real-world entities like Guest, Room, Reservation, etc.
Encapsulation: Data members and member functions are encapsulated within classes.
Inheritance: Relationships like Room types (e.g., Standard, Deluxe) inherit from a base Room class.
Polymorphism: Virtual functions for dynamic method binding (e.g., calculating bill for different room types).
Abstraction: Hide complex implementation details from the user.
